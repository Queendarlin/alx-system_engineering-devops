# Networking Basics Project
This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of fundamental networking concepts. 

### OSI Model
- **What it is:** The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.
- **How many layers it has:** Seven layers.
- **How it is organized:** The model is organized in a way that each layer provides a specific set of functions, and each layer relies on the functions provided by the layer below it.

### LAN (Local Area Network)
- **What it is:** A LAN is a network that is limited to a small geographic area, such as a single building or a campus.
- **Typical usage:** Connecting computers and devices within an organization for local communication and resource sharing.
- **Typical geographical size:** Small, usually within a building or a campus.

### WAN (Wide Area Network)
- **What it is:** A WAN is a network that covers a broad area, often connecting multiple LANs across cities or even countries.
- **Typical usage:** Connecting geographically dispersed LANs, enabling communication and resource sharing over long distances.
- **Typical geographical size:** Large, covering a wide area such as a city, country, or global connections.

### Internet
- **What it is:** The Internet is a global network of networks that connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks.
- **How it works:** It uses the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.

### IP Address
- **What it is:** An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network using the Internet Protocol for communication.
- **Types of IP addresses:** IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit).

### Localhost
- **What it is:** Localhost refers to the loopback address, typically represented as 127.0.0.1, used to access the network services on the local host via the network interface.

### Subnet
- **What it is:** A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network into multiple, smaller network segments.

### IPv6
- **Why it was created:** IPv6 was created to address the limitation of available IP addresses in IPv4 due to the increasing number of devices connected to the Internet.

### TCP/UDP
- **What they are:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are transport layer protocols.
- **Difference:** TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication, while UDP offers faster but less reliable communication.

### Port
- **What it is:** A port is a communication endpoint in a computer's operating system used for network communication.
- **Examples:** SSH (Port 22), HTTP (Port 80), HTTPS (Port 443).

### Checking Network Connectivity
- **Tool/Protocol:** Ping is often used to check if a device is connected to a network. It operates at the ICMP layer and sends echo requests to the target device.
